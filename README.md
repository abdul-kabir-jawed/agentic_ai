## 🌟 What is an AI Agent?

An **AI Agent** is an autonomous software entity that perceives its environment, makes decisions, and takes actions to achieve specific goals. Think of it as a digital assistant with the ability to reason, learn, and adapt to changing conditions without constant human supervision.

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   Perception    │───▶│   Cognition     │───▶│     Action      │
│     Module      │    │     Engine      │    │    Executor     │
└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
         │                       │                       │
         ▼                       ▼                       ▼
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   Environment   │    │     Memory      │    │   Feedback      │
│   Interface     │    │     System      │    │     Loop        │
└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
