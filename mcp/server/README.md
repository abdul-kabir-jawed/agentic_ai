# 🌟 Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers

## 🎯 What are MCP Servers?

MCP servers are specialized programs that bridge AI applications with external systems through standardized protocol interfaces. They act as intelligent connectors, allowing AI models to interact with various services and data sources in a controlled, secure manner.

## 🏗️ Core Architecture

### Three Fundamental Building Blocks

#### 🔧 **Tools**
*Active functions controlled by the AI model*

**Purpose**: Enable the AI to perform actions and execute operations based on user requests

**Capabilities**:
- Write to databases
- Call external APIs  
- Modify files
- Trigger business logic

**Examples**:
- ✈️ Search flights
- 💬 Send messages
- 📅 Create calendar events

**Control**: **Model-driven** - The AI decides when and how to use these tools

---

#### 📚 **Resources** 
*Passive data sources for contextual information*

**Purpose**: Provide read-only access to information that enhances AI understanding

**Capabilities**:
- File content retrieval
- Database schema access
- API documentation reading
- Knowledge base queries

**Examples**:
- 📄 Retrieve documents
- 🗄️ Access knowledge bases
- 📆 Read calendar data

**Control**: **Application-managed** - The hosting application determines access

---

#### 💡 **Prompts**
*Pre-built instruction templates*

**Purpose**: Standardized workflows that combine tools and resources for specific tasks

**Capabilities**:
- Guide AI behavior
- Orchestrate complex operations
- Ensure consistent outputs

**Examples**:
- 🌴 Plan a vacation
- 📝 Summarize meetings
- ✉️ Draft emails

**Control**: **User-initiated** - Triggered by user requests or application logic

## 🔄 How It All Works Together

The three building blocks create a powerful ecosystem:

1. **Resources** provide the context and information the AI needs
2. **Tools** give the AI the ability to take action on that information  
3. **Prompts** orchestrate the entire workflow with clear instructions

This combination enables AI applications to move beyond simple conversation into meaningful interaction with real-world systems and data.
