## 🛠️ Implementation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Sequential Processing

Execute tools in a specific order:

```
1. Gather Context (Read Resources)
   ↓
2. Research Options (Search Tools)
   ↓
3. Make Decisions (Compare & Filter)
   ↓
4. Execute Actions (Booking Tools)
   ↓
5. Confirm & Notify (Communication Tools)
```

---

### Pattern 2: Parallel Processing

Execute independent operations simultaneously:

```mermaid
graph TB
    Start[Context Gathered] --> P1[Search Flights]
    Start --> P2[Check Weather]
    Start --> P3[Search Hotels]
    
    P1 --> Combine[Combine Results]
    P2 --> Combine
    P3 --> Combine
    
    Combine --> Book[Make Bookings]
```

---

### Pattern 3: Conditional Logic

Adapt workflow based on results:

```python
if budget_remaining > hotel_cost:
    book_hotel()
    add_activities()
else:
    find_cheaper_hotel()
    reduce_activities()

if weather_forecast == "rainy":
    suggest_indoor_attractions()
else:
    suggest_outdoor_attractions()
```

---

## ✅ Best Practices

### For Server Developers

#### 1. Clear Server Boundaries 🎯

Each server should have a **well-defined responsibility**:

- ✅ **Good:** Weather Server handles only climate data
- ❌ **Bad:** Weather Server also books flights

#### 2. Consistent Resource URIs 🔗

Use predictable, hierarchical naming:

```
travel://preferences/[region]
travel://past-trips/[trip-id]
calendar://[calendar-name]/[period]
```

#### 3. Robust Error Handling 🚨

Plan for failures across servers:

```python
try:
    flight = searchFlights(params)
except FlightNotFoundError:
    notify_user("No flights found in budget")
    suggest_alternatives()
```

#### 4. Efficient Resource Access 📊

Minimize redundant reads:

```python
# ✅ Good: Read once, use multiple times
preferences = read_resource("travel://preferences/europe")
filter_flights(preferences)
filter_hotels(preferences)

# ❌ Bad: Read multiple times
filter_flights(read_resource("travel://preferences/europe"))
filter_hotels(read_resource("travel://preferences/europe"))
```

---

### For AI Implementations

#### 1. Context-First Approach 🔍

Always gather context before taking action:

```
Read Resources → Understand Context → Execute Tools
```

#### 2. User Confirmation for High-Stakes Actions 👤

Request approval before:
- 💰 Spending money
- 📧 Sending external communications
- 🗑️ Deleting data
- 🔒 Changing security settings

#### 3. Progress Communication 📢

Keep users informed during long workflows:

```
✅ Searching flights...
✅ Flights found! Checking weather...
✅ Weather looks great! Finding hotels...
✅ Hotel options found! Ready to book?
```

#### 4. Graceful Degradation 🛡️

Continue when servers are unavailable:

```python
try:
    weather = checkWeather(location, dates)
except WeatherServerOffline:
    weather = "Weather data unavailable"
    # Continue with booking anyway
```

---

### For Application Designers

#### 1. Transparent Server Usage 👁️

Show users which servers are involved:

```
🌍 Using Travel Server for flights
🌤️ Using Weather Server for forecasts
📅 Using Calendar Server for scheduling
```

#### 2. Resource Selection UI 🎨

Make it easy to choose relevant resources:

- 📋 Show resource previews
- 🏷️ Group by server/category
- 🔍 Enable searching
- ⭐ Suggest frequently used resources

#### 3. Tool Execution Visibility ⚡

Display tool calls in real-time:

```
Running: searchFlights(origin: "NYC", destination: "Barcelona")
Running: checkWeather(location: "Barcelona", dates: "June 15-22")
Running: bookHotel(location: "Barcelona", budget: 1200)
```
