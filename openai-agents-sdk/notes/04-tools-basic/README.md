# ðŸ”§ AI Tool Calling Guide

## What is a "tool" in AI?

A **tool** is a **specialized function** that handles one specific task really well (like calculating numbers or fetching weather data). Your AI can **request** a tool to perform that task and then use the result to respond to you.

> **Simple definition:** *A tool is an external helper that your AI can use to accomplish specific tasks.*

## What is "tool calling"?

**Tool calling** happens when the AI **chooses to use a tool** during a conversation to get information or perform actions.

**Example Flow:**

1. **User asks:** "What's the weather in New York?"
2. **AI realizes:** "I need current weather data."
3. **AI calls tool:** `get_weather(city="New York")`
4. **Tool responds:** `{"temp": 28, "condition": "Sunny"}`
5. **AI replies:** "It's 28Â°C and sunny in New York."

Think of it like using a **calculator** during a math test: you decide *when* to use it, input the numbers, get the result, and write your final answer.

## Why are tools necessary?

* **AI knowledge isn't current.** Tools provide real-time information (weather, news, stock prices).
* **AI can't perform actions.** Tools can *execute tasks* (send emails, make bookings, run calculations).
* **Precision matters.** Tools ensure accurate math, database queries, and rule enforcement.

## Common tool categories

| Tool Type       | Purpose                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Search**      | Find information online  |
| **Calculator**  | Perform exact calculations |
| **Weather**     | Get current weather data |
| **Email/SMS**   | Send messages            |
| **Code Runner** | Execute code securely    |
| **Database**    | Store/retrieve data      |

## Real-world analogies

* **Smartphone:** Your phone (AI) opens specific apps (tools) when needed - Maps for navigation, Camera for photos.
* **Restaurant:** The chef (AI) uses different equipment (tools) - blender for smoothies, oven for baking.
* **Workplace:** A manager (AI) consults different systems (tools) - HR database for employee info, accounting software for budgets.

## Tool calling process

1. **Recognize need:** "This requires external help."
2. **Select tool:** Choose the appropriate helper.
3. **Prepare inputs:** Format the required parameters (e.g., `city="New York"`).
4. **Execute tool:** Make the function call.
5. **Process result:** Convert output into natural language response.
6. **Chain if needed:** Use additional tools if the task requires it.

## Hands-on demonstration (no coding required)

* Create tool cards: **Calculator**, **Weather**, **Dictionary**.
* Assign roles: one **AI**, three **Tool operators**, one **User**.
* User asks: "What's 15Ã—27 and is it warmer than 25Â°C in London?"
* **AI** decides to:
  * Call **Calculator** â†’ receives `405`
  * Call **Weather** â†’ receives `29Â°C`
* **AI** responds: "15Ã—27 equals 405. Yes, London is warmer at 29Â°C than 25Â°C."

This exercise makes tool calling tangible and interactive.

## Tool structure (basic concept)

You define a **name**, **required inputs**, and **expected output**:

```
Tool name: get_weather
Input: city (string)
Output: { temperature: number, condition: string }
```

The AI identifies weather-related questions and automatically provides the `city` parameter from the user's message.

## When to use tools vs. when not to

* **Use tools for:** Live data, precise calculations, database operations, sending communications, performing real actions.
* **Skip tools for:** General explanations, creative writing, conceptual discussions, or basic knowledge questions.

---

## Best practices for tool builders

* **Single purpose** (one tool, one job).
* **Clear naming** (e.g., `send_email(recipient, subject, message)`).
* **Consistent outputs** (structured JSON responses).
* **Error handling** (graceful failures when data isn't available).
* **Security first** (input validation, no exposed credentials).

## Test your understanding

Guess which tool you'd need for these requests:

1. "Translate this phrase to Spanish."
2. "Find the cheapest hotel in Paris."
3. "Remember my preference for next time."

**Solutions:**

1. *Translation tool*
2. *Search tool + Price comparison tool*
3. *Database storage tool*
