🎯 Tips for Success
-------------------

-   **📹 YouTube**: Search for tutorials on channels like freeCodeCamp, Corey Schafer, Tech With Tim, and sentdex (e.g., "Corey Schafer Python OOP tutorial").
-   **📖 Documentation**: Regularly consult [OpenAI Agents SDK](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/), [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), and [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm).
-   **💬 Community**: Engage on X (#OpenAIAgentsSDK, #Python) and Stack Overflow for solutions to errors like `TypeError` or `ResolutionError`.
-   **🛠️ Environment**: Use `uv --version` to verify setup and `uv sync` for dependency updates.
-   **🔑 Gemini API**: If no key, mock API responses initially; use Google's free tier when available.
-   **🐞 Debugging**: Read error messages, use `print` for debugging, and search X/Stack Overflow for specific errors.
-   **🚀 Progress**: Track milestones (e.g., first agent, first multi-agent system) to stay motivated.
